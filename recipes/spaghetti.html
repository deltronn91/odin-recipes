        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>Making spaghetti is not hard at all. You first need a few basic
            ingredients like <strong>noodles</strong> that are strong and thick.
            You'll also want to make sure you select <strong>tomoato sauce</strong>
            that packs a punch. Lastly, <strong>meat</strong> is optional. If you're
            anything like me, though you'll probably want vegan meat.
