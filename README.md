In this lesson I learned all about Git and when to make meaningful connections
Generally speaking, the purpose of a meaningful commit when working with git and github is for
adding context as to WHAT AND WHY we made a change and for collaboration purposes.
We should make commits early and often. Commits are also awesome because they allow us to go back
to our last working piece of code whenever we encounter a new problem.

a good commit message has a subject line no more than about 50 characters written in imperative language.
our body is the description of the changes we made, i.e., the what we did and why we did it, adding farther
context to the changes.
